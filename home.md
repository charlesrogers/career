## My Side Quest:
My sole purpose is to build things, but I've found I am often without the necessary instrumentation to identify the causal forces in the world to achieve those goal. Whenever I do so I can use those forces to achieve even greater things in the world.

Things that fall into this mandate:
1. create vocabulary to define and explain phenomena and create hypotheses around their underlying causality
2. build instrumentation to measure phenomena and the strength of the causal forces
3. build tools to harness forces/try and convince product managers to build those things

# Proof of Work
## QuantJTBD

## People Like *You*
People signed up. People found love. More importantly I proved to the world that it is possible to build a dating "app" in R.
## Cleanstreamit
Serial founder? Serial Failure? Whatever, I build things I want to exist.

The Anduril of insect erradication? No one would ever be that bold, but maybe they should have.

### Jesus Christ
Weird to cite our Lord and Savior as a source, but He really is so cool.
Did you know the purpose of life is to understand the mysteries of godliness? In that vein, God has provided us with tools to learn of His life and His way. You might disagree with this, but have you really tried it? Have you spend thousands of hours looking at the causal forces of exaltation and then tried to implement them?
### Joseph Smith
Do you care about the cosmos? Did you know Abraham was an astronomer?
You've come to the right place.
