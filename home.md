## Mission:
My sole purpose is to build correct instrumentation to identify the causal forces in the world. when I do so, then I can use those forces to achieve things.
Things that qualify:
1. create vocabulary to define and explain phenomena and the underlying causality
2. build instrumentation to measure phenomena 
3. build tools to harness forces
