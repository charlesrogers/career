## My Side Quest:
My sole purpose is to build things, but I've found I am often without the necessary instrumentation to identify the causal forces in the world to achieve those goal. Whenever I do so I can use those forces to achieve even greater things in the world.

Things that fall into this mandate:
1. create vocabulary to define and explain phenomena and the underlying causality
2. build instrumentation to measure phenomena 
3. build tools to harness forces

## Built Work
### People Like *You*
People signed up. People found love. More importantly I proved to the world that it is possible to build a dating "app" in R.
### Cleanstreamit
Serial founder? Serial Failure? Whatever, I build things I want to exist.

### Jesus Christ
Weird to cite our Lord and Savior as a source, but He really is so cool.
Did you know the purpose of life is to understand the mysteries of godliness? In that vein, God has provided us with tools to learn of His life and His way. You might disagree with this, but have you really tried it? Have you spend thousands of hours looking at the causal forces of exaltation and then tried to implement them?
